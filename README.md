# About
AI Telegram Bot Reminder. You send a free-form text-reminder OR record a voice message, the AI bot records it and reminds you at the right time :) Try it out!

# How it works
You type in any text OR send a voice message, we convert and split it with AI like this:
- You: hey, remind me about my haircut tomorrow at 8 am
- Bot: Got you! Set a reminder "haircut" at 8 am. tomorrow. I'm sure you'll be stunning after it!

Set up your account with settings (optional, up to you)
